# Tch
This tool let you create files from console in Windows with single command (instead of default `echo "" > file.txt`). <br>
In general this program is useless, but it makes life a little bit easier when you work in the console a lot.

## Usage
Tch doesn't have flags and nested commands yet, so the usage is very simple. <br>

## Creating files
To create files, you need to specify paths to them using spaces between. <br>
If some folders in path doesn't exist they will be created. <br>
<strong>Example:</strong> `tch test.txt` or `tch test1.txt test2.txt somefolder/test2.txt` to create multiple files
