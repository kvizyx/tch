# Tch
This tool let you create files from console in Windows with single command (instead of default `echo "" > file.txt`). <br>
In general this program is useless, but it makes life a little bit easier when you work in the console a lot.

## Usage
Tch doesn't have flags and nested commands yet, so the usage is very simple.<br>
``tch [PATH_TO_FILE]``<br><br>
Also you can create multiple files in one command by specifying paths with spaces between.<br>
``tch [PATH_TO_FILE1] [PATH_TO_FILE2] ...``
