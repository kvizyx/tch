# Tch
This tool let you create files from console in Windows with single command (instead of default `echo "" > file.txt`). <br>
In general this program is useless, but it makes life a little bit easier when you work in the console a lot.

## Usage
Tch doesn't have flags and nested commands yet, so the usage is elementary.<br>
``tch [PATHS]``<br>
